# Python Specialisation Course

## Achievement 1

EXERCISE 1.1
1. Install and create Virtual environments using "pip"
2. Created python file in my IDE using basic Python syntax.

In this folder you will encounter:
- add.py file
- the requirements file which holds the lists package requirements
- screenshots of the steps I took in order to install ipython and virtual envs
- my learning journal for this exercise

EXERCISE 1.2
Understanding Data Types in Python by following code practice tasks.

In this folder you will encounter:
- recipes.py file where 5 recipes have been stored as Dictionaries. The reason why they are stored using dictionaries is because of its flexibility, the data that is stored varies which makes it much more effective and lastly dictionaries are mutable so if any recipe needs an adjustment it can be done without any issue.
- screenshots of the steps I took when storing the data into dictionaries
- my learning journal for this exercise and added questions from previous exercise
